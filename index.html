        My name is Jacob, and my passion is music. A few years ago, my passion
        took me adn a couple friends to SXSW music festival. We were there to
        perform and enjoy performances for a few days. Overall the experience
        was hectic but enjoyable

        Not everything went perfectly, and I'll get to that later but day one
        was great. On our first day, we performed. Performing was fun, it was
        our first time in Austin and everybody was really friendly and engaged
        with the artists.

        Now, we get to day two. Long story short, we got kicked out of our
        hotel. So, we were afforded a limited amount of time to pack our stuff
        and find somewhere to go. This wasnt easy for us, being that we weren't
        familiar with Austin at all. Another hurdle in the way was the fact that
        there was a big music festival going on so most of the hotels didn't
        have many rooms remainging. Long story even shorter, We spent a few
        hours at a Burger King with all of our luggage and equptment on our
        backs calling hotels to stay at and we ended up finding one. We all
        sruvived the Austin heat and lived happily ever after.

      This story is <em>OBVIOUSLY</em> incredibly interesting so of course,
      Netflix has began working on a short film about it. So this story is
      trademarked as The Most Interesting Story of All Time: Jacob's Tale That's
      Totally Not Just For an Assignment"&trade;
